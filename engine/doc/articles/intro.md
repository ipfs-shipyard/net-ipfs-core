# IPFS Engine

An [IPFS](https:/ipfs.io) engine implemented in C#.  Provides an API for decentralised and distributed applications.

IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines good ideas from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web. It is like a single bittorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built in. 

The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/richardschneider/net-ipfs-engine) and the 
package is published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ipfs.Engine).
