# IPFS Core

The [core objects](api/Ipfs.yml) of the [Inter Planetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS) for .Net (C#, VB, F# etc.) 
The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/richardschneider/net-ipfs-core) and the 
package on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ipfs.Core).

The interplanetary file system is the permanent web. It is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
